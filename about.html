            Hi, I am <br />
            Ilaria Vilardi
          </h1>
          <h3 class="mb-4">Frontend student based in Berlin</h3>
          <p class="text-muted mb-5">
            I was born and raised in Molfetta, South Italy. In 2016 I moved to
            Germany where I first worked as a hotel receptionist in Munich, then
            as a Support Agent in Berlin, and currently I developed my career
            into an Operations Support Manager. At the same time I'm learning
            frontend development at SheCodes and, in my free time, I follow my
            hobby as an artist and colorist: I collaborate with an Instagram
            page that talks about Korea by drawing Korean meals for them, I draw
            my own personal creations, and I work as a colorist for some
            upcoming comics that will be published in Italy. I wish that in the
            future I can find a job that combines everything that I can do and
            that I'm learning!
